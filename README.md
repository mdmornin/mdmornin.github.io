## About Me

I am a graduate student at IUPUI interested in how alcohol affects cognition. Broadly, I hope to utilize cutting-edge in vivo electrophysiology recording techniques and analysis methods to further our understanding of how acute alcohol intoxication affects decision making, memory, and inhibition. 

I will be graduating no-later than the Spring of 2023 and I am currently on the market for post doctoral positions. An updated CV can be found here [here](https://github.com/mdmornin/mitchellmorningstar.github.io/blob/master/morningstar_cv.pdf) and an NIH Biosketch can be found [here](https://github.com/mdmornin/mitchellmorningstar.github.io/blob/master/Morningstar_NIHBiosketch.pdf).
