## About Me

### Blurb
I am a graduate student at IUPUI interested in how alcohol affects cognition. Broadly, I hope to utilize cutting-edge in vivo electrophysiology recording techniques and analysis methods to further our understanding of how acute alcohol intoxication affects decision making, memory, and inhibition. 

I will be graduating no-later than the Spring of 2023 and I am currently on the market for post doctoral positions.
